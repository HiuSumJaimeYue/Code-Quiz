# Code-Quiz
This is the code quiz made by Hiu Sum Jaime Yue.    

In this code quiz web application, there are five multiple choice questions on the quiz. The starting timer is 75 seconds. In this quiz, the timer is the score that you will get at the end. When you are doing the quiz, the faster and more accurate you are, the better score you will get. When any question is answered wrong, time will be reduced by 10 seconds.     

On the top of the code quiz web application, there is a button that you can view the high scores any time of the quiz on the left and the timer is on the right.          

In this code quiz web application, there are four different style of pages, including starting page, question page, finish page and highscores page.             

After you clicked the Start Quiz button, the quiz will start and you will see the question and 4 multiple choices in the center of the page. When you finish the quiz or if you run out of time, the finish page will be shown. You can put in your initials as a record for the highscores page. If nothing was put into the input box, you name will be set as "No name". After submitting your initials, you can check on the highscores page where your name and score are on the ranking.       

When you are on the highscores page, you can see a ranking of everyone who finished in the test before. There are two buttons below the ranking, which are the Go back button and Clear Highscores button. The Go back button will bring you back to the starting page. The Clear Highscores button will clear the ranking. Therefore, the next time you finished the quiz, you will be on the top of the list.
