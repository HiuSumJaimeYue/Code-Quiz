# Code-Quiz
This is the code quiz made by Hiu Sum Jaime Yue.    

In this code quiz web application, there are five multiple choice questions on the quiz. The starting timer is 75 seconds. In this quiz, the timer is the score that you will get at the end. When you are doing the quiz, the faster and more accurate you are, the better score you will get. When any question is answered wrong, time will be reduced by 10 seconds.     

On the top of the code quiz application, there is a button that you can view the high scores any time of the quiz on the left and the timer on the right.          

When you clicked the Start Quiz button, the quiz will start and you will see the question and 4 multiple choices in the center of the page. When you finish the quiz or if you run out of time, the finish  page will be shown. You can put in your initials as a record for the high score page. If nothing was put into the input box, you name will be set as "No name". After submitting your initials, you can check on the high scores page where your name and score are.       

When you are on the high score, you can see a ranking of everyone who participated in the test before. There are two buttons below the ranking, which are the Go back button and Clear Highscores button. The Go back button will bring you back to the starting quiz. The Clear Highscores button will clear the ranking. Therefore, the next time you finished the quiz, you will get a score and be on the top of the list.
