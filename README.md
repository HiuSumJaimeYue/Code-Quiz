# Code-Quiz
This is the code quiz made by Hiu Sum Jaime Yue.    

In this code quiz web application, there are five multiple choice questions on the quiz. The starting timer is 60 seconds. In this quiz, the timer is the score you will get at the end. The faster and more accurate you are when you are doing the quiz, the better score you will have. When any question is answered wrong, time will be reduced by 10 seconds.     

On the top of the code quiz application, there is a button that you can view the high scores any time of the quiz on the left and the timer on the right.           
When you clicked the Start Quiz button, the quiz will start and you will see the question and 4 multiple choices in the center of the page. When you finish the quiz or if you run out of time, the finish  page will be shown. You can put in your initials as a record for the high score page. After submitting your initials, you can check if your name and score are high enough to go on the high scores page.
When you are on the high score, you can see a ranking of everyone who participated in the test before. There are two buttons below the ranking, which are the Go back button and Clear Highscores button. The Go back button will bring you back to the starting quiz. The Clear Highscores button will clear the ranking. Therefore, the next time you participate in the quiz and get a score and be on the top of the list.
